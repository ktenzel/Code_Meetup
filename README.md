## Project Overview
<!-- Basic Overview goes here -->
<!-- REMOVE API KEY & API KEY HISTORY -->
## Install

First, clone this repo:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ktenzel/Code_Meetup.git
```

From your terminal, cd into the directory you just cloned:

> :children_crossing: Path below is just an example an likely doesn't exist, unless of course you cloned into you desktop.

```sh
$ cd ~/Desktop/Code_Meetup
```

Install all npm packages:

```sh
$ npm install
```

<!-- Edit api-keys file -->

Now we need to setup our Firebase function, start off by installing the firebase-tools npm package.
> Install this globally or locally, either or. (If you're going to be working with Firebase a lot and on multiple projects, I suggest you install it globally or use something like env)

```sh
$ npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Next, we will need to authenticate the firebase tool:
> Sign in with the same account you used to create your Firebase database.

```sh
$ firebase login
```

Last set of npm packages:

```sh
$ cd functions && npm install
```

You're ready to roll. Just run this angular cli task:

```sh
$ ng serve
```
